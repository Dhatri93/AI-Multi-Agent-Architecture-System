# AI-Multi-Agent-Architecture-System
Overview
This project designs a Multi-Agent architecture that researches the Retail industry, generates relevant AI/GenAI use cases, and collects resource assets (datasets and tools) to enhance operations and customer experiences.

1)  Architecture Flow
Industry Research Agent
Researches the Retail industry.
Focuses on areas like supply chain, customer experience, and inventory management.

2)  Market Standards & Use Case Generator
Analyzes AI, ML, and GenAI trends in Retail.
Proposes use cases like:
Personalized Product Recommendations
Demand Forecasting
AI-powered Customer Support Chatbots
Automated Inventory Management

3)  Final Proposal Output (Sample)
Top Use Cases:
• Personalized Recommendations
• Demand Forecasting
• AI Chatbots for Support
• Inventory Management with CV

4)Technologies Used
Python
Selenium (for Web Research)
HuggingFace APIs
Kaggle API
GitHub Scraping
